# Dota-2-Server-Ping-Check
Application for checking ping and packet loss before starting the game.
1. Dota2 takes time to get started even on an i7 laptop. It takes at least 30 seconds to start. It is very annoying that you wait for 30 seconds + time, and only then you see that your ping is not suitable for the game, and you need to close it.

2. Dota2 still does not report the loss of packages before the start of the match. this means that if you start a Ranked game and lose the package, you won't be able to do anything in time, since you have already started the game,and all this will result in -25 MMR. This tool tells you about packet loss if there is a packet loss on some server

3. the tool has many sorting options, such as sorting by least ping, by server name, and so On.

4. you can check the ping to the servers without running the Dota 2 app

5. ping Check if you are using a Vpn to work.

6. Detailed information about how to use the program is included in the program. Download it to open the binary folder. There you will find the compiled executable file.
